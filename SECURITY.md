# Security Policy

## Scope
- Security coverage applies to the `main` branch and published releases; forks and custom deployments are self-supported.
- The project ships static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Server-side incidents fall outside this scope.

## Reporting
- Do not open public issues for suspected vulnerabilities.
- Submit reports through GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" workflow or email the maintainer listed on the repository profile.
- Provide reproduction steps, affected files, browser context, and any suggested mitigations.
- Mark the report as time-bound if external disclosure deadlines apply.

## Response
- Maintainers acknowledge valid reports as bandwidth permits and will coordinate fixes and disclosure timing with the reporter.
