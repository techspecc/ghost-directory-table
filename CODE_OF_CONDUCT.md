# Code of Conduct

- Communicate in concise, solution-focused language to keep collaboration efficient.
- Capture table behavior changes, browser support impacts, and data assumptions in every pull request.
- Provide reproducible steps, including sample rows or data files, when reporting UI or sorting issues.
- Keep critiques professional and target the work, not the contributor.
- Maintainers may edit submissions, request clarifications, or defer merges to preserve project stability.
